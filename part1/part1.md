1. i is defined as global scope, and prices.length -1 will be printed
2. discountedPrice is  defined and is the value lastprice *(1-discount)
3. finalPrice is defined and is the same as the last value in the discounted array
4. It will return [50,100,150] because it takes each integer in the prices array and cuts them in half.
5. i is not defined because it has block scope
6. discountedPrice is not defined because it has block scope
7.  finalPrice is the last integer in the discounted array and defined because it was declaredo outside of  the for loop
8. it will return [50,100,150] because it cuts eachprice in half
9. i is undefined because it has block scope
10. undefined because it has block scope
11. it has function scope, so it is printed correctly
12. [0,0,0] because finalPrice is put into array and its value is set to 0 permanently

14. A 32 string concatenation
    B 1  convert '3' to int then subtract 2
    C. 3, null is NAN which is essentially 0
    D. '3null', string concatenation
    E. 4, true is converted to integer for addition
    F. 0, false is converted to number and added to NAN
    G.'3undefined' , string concatenation
    H. NAN, due to subtraction undefined is made into the number NAN
15. A true string '2' convert to integer
    B false  no conversion because both vales are string
    C true string '2' convert to integer
    D false === is a strict comparer
    E false, true is equal to 1 not 2
    F true, all values converted to boolean are true except for 0
16. === is strict equality operator which checks without type conversion, while == does type conversion
17. How are you? gets printed because 2 is converted into boolean true
